# Java Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to the **Java Data Structures and Algorithms** repository! This repository contains a collection of data structures and algorithms implementations in Java. it's designed to help students, developers and enthusiasts learn and practice DSA concepts in a hands-on manner.

## Introduction

Data structures and algorithms form the backbone of computer science and software development. This repository includes a variety of commonly used data structures (like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.) and algorithms ( such as searching, sorting, dynamic programming, etc.) implemented in Java.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Examples:** Detailed implementations of basic and advanced data structures and algorithms.
- **Well-commented Code:** Clear explanations of the logic and approach used in each implementation.
